# DNSCrypt blocklists

This repo contains the domain names and the IPv4/IPv6 addresses of [public DNSCrypt servers](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers).

The dnscrypt-parse script runs automatically every 6 hours via GitHub actions and updates all the output files within the repo if anything has changed.
